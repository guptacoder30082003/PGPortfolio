                <h2>Aditya Birla Public School, Khor: A Journey of Growth and Learning (2007-2021)</h2>
                <ul>My school life at Aditya Birla Public School, Khor, from 2007 to 2021, was transformative. In the corridors of ABPS, my father, a dedicated math teacher and Head of Examinations, added a familial touch. His commitment fostered belonging and a deep appreciation for learning. Reflecting on those years, I carry lessons learned, friendships forged, and the indelible mark of ABPS on my journey. It was more than an institution; it was a second home, a community that shaped me.</ul>

Beyond academics, extracurricular activities honed my leadership skills. The supportive community and friendships forged during group projects and events made the campus a second home. LNCT, with its nurturing environment, played a pivotal role in shaping not just my career but my overall perspective on life.
